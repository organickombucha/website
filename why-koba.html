  <h1>Why Koba</h1>

  <p>
    Koba Organics stands for clean ingredients, ethical sourcing,
    and products that support healthy living.
  </p>

  <p>
    We choose quality over shortcuts and sustainability over trends.
  </p>

  <h2>Fizz that hits different. Sip bold. Feel unstoppable.</h2>

<p>For new, bold flavours you can always depend on us. We do different.</p>

<p>
  KOBA Organics is kombucha that doesn’t play it safe. We craft naturally fermented, probiotic-rich fizz with flavour that actually shows up — not the face-scrunching vinegar punch you get from some other kombuchas.
</p>

<h2>What makes KOBA… KOBA</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🔥 <strong>Bold Flavours, No Compromises:</strong> Gooseberry sparkle. Pineapple sweetness. Turmeric with attitude. Layered, punchy flavours that taste fresh, balanced, and never boring.</li>
  <li>😌 <strong>Smooth, Not Vinegary:</strong> We’ve fine-tuned our fermentation so KOBA stays bright and refreshing — not harsh, not overpowering, and definitely not vinegary. Just clean fizz with a crisp finish.</li>
  <li>🌱 <strong>Gut-Friendly by Nature:</strong> Packed with live probiotics that support your gut microbiome — the little legends behind digestion, energy, and how good you feel day to day.</li>
  <li>🍃 <strong>Clean & Organic:</strong> No added sugar. 100% organic ingredients. No weird stuff. Ever. Because your gut deserves better than shortcuts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>💬 The KOBA Promise</h3>
<p>We don’t do bland. We don’t do fake. We don’t do kombucha that tastes like regret. We do bold, balanced, feel-good fizz — every single time.</p>
